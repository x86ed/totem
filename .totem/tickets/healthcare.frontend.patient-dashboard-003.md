# Patient Dashboard Redesign

Modern React-based dashboard with real-time data visualization, accessibility compliance, and mobile responsiveness.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Wireframes approved by UX team
- [x] Component library integration
- [ ] Real-time vitals display
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- [ ] Mobile responsive design
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (< 2s load time)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing completed

## Implementation Notes
```typescript
// Use ChartJS for vitals visualization
// Implement WebSocket connection for real-time updates
// Follow design system tokens from /src/design-tokens/
// Ensure proper error boundaries for data failures
```

### Risks

- Performance issues with real-time updates (medium)
- Complex state management (high)
