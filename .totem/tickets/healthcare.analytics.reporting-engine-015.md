# Analytics and Reporting Engine

Advanced analytics dashboard with custom report generation, data visualization, and automated insights for healthcare metrics.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Data warehouse connection
- [ ] Custom report builder UI
- [ ] Scheduled report generation
- [ ] Email notification system
- [ ] Data export capabilities (PDF, Excel)
- [ ] Real-time analytics dashboard
- [ ] HIPAA compliance verification

## Implementation Notes
```python
# Use Apache Superset for dashboards
# Implement Celery for background report generation
# Use Pandas for data processing
# Follow HL7 FHIR for healthcare data standards
```

**Risks:** Large dataset performance (high), Complex data relationships (high), Compliance requirements (medium)
