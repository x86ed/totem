# Mobile App Data Synchronization

Implement offline-first mobile application with background sync capabilities for patient data access in remote areas.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Offline data storage implemented
- [ ] Background sync mechanism
- [ ] Conflict resolution strategy
- [ ] Network failure handling
- [ ] Data encryption at rest
- [ ] iOS and Android compatibility
- [ ] Battery optimization

## Implementation Notes
```javascript
// Use SQLite for local storage
// Implement exponential backoff for sync retries
// Use Redux Persist for state management
// Follow FHIR standards for data exchange
```

**Risks:** Data consistency issues (high), Battery drain concerns (medium), App store approval delays (low)
