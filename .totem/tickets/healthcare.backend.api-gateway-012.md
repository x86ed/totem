# API Gateway Implementation

Centralized API gateway for microservices with rate limiting, authentication, and monitoring capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Kong or AWS API Gateway setup
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] API key management
- [ ] Request/response logging
- [ ] Health check endpoints
- [ ] Load balancing configuration
- [ ] API documentation generated

## Implementation Notes
```yaml
# Configure rate limits: 1000 req/hour per user
# Implement JWT token validation
# Set up CloudWatch monitoring
# Use OpenAPI 3.0 for documentation
```

**Risks:** Single point of failure (medium), Configuration complexity (medium), Performance bottlenecks (low)
