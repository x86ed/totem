# Mobile App Secure Messaging & Alerts

## Overview

Develop a secure, offline-capable messaging and alert system within the mobile healthcare app, enabling field workers to communicate critical patient updates, receive emergency alerts, and coordinate care even in low-connectivity environments.

## Detailed Description

### Core Challenge

Healthcare teams in the field need to exchange urgent information and receive system-wide alerts, but connectivity is unreliable. This feature ensures that messages and alerts are queued and delivered as soon as a connection is available, maintaining care continuity and rapid response.

### Target User Personas

- Rural healthcare providers needing to coordinate with base clinics
- Community health workers sharing patient status updates
- Disaster relief coordinators sending mass alerts to field teams

### Technical Architecture Overview

- **Encrypted Local Message Store:** All messages stored securely on device
- **Sync Engine:** Queues outgoing/incoming messages for later delivery
- **Push Notification Integration:** For real-time alerts when online
- **Role-based Access:** Only authorized users can send/receive certain alerts

### User Interface and Experience Design

- **Inbox & Outbox:** Clear separation of sent/received messages
- **Alert Banner:** Prominent display of critical alerts
- **Offline Indicator:** Shows when messages are pending sync

### Integration Requirements

- **HL7 Messaging Support:** For clinical alerts
- **Audit Logging:** All message activity tracked for compliance

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Secure local message storage
- [ ] Offline message queueing
- [ ] Push notification integration
- [ ] Role-based alert permissions
- [ ] HL7 alert support

## Implementation Notes

- Use end-to-end encryption for all messages
- Integrate with device push notification services
- Implement message retry and delivery confirmation

### Risks

- Message delivery delays (medium)
- Security vulnerabilities (high)
- User confusion with offline/online status (low)
