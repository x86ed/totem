# Active Directory Integration Setup

Configure secure LDAP connection to hospital's Active Directory for centralized user authentication and role management.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] LDAP connection established
- [x] SSL/TLS encryption configured
- [x] User group mapping completed
- [x] Failover mechanism implemented
- [x] Security audit passed
- [x] Documentation updated

## Implementation Notes
```bash
# Configure LDAP settings in /etc/ldap/ldap.conf
# Set up connection pooling for performance
# Implement proper error handling for AD downtime
# Use service account with minimal privileges
```

### Risks

- Network connectivity issues (low)
- AD server maintenance windows (low)
