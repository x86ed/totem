# Mobile App Imaging & Document Sync

## Overview

Enable offline capture, storage, and synchronization of medical images and documents (e.g., wound photos, lab results, consent forms) within the mobile healthcare app, supporting field data collection and later upload to central EHR systems.

## Detailed Description

### Core Challenge

Field healthcare workers must document patient conditions and collect forms, but cannot always upload them immediately due to poor connectivity. This feature allows secure, offline-first capture and sync of images and documents, ensuring no data is lost.

### Target User Personas

- Rural doctors capturing wound progress photos
- Community nurses uploading signed consent forms
- Disaster teams collecting triage documentation

### Technical Architecture Overview

- **Local Encrypted Storage:** Images and documents stored securely on device
- **Sync Engine:** Handles upload when network is available
- **Compression & Optimization:** Reduces file size for bandwidth efficiency
- **Metadata Tagging:** Enables search and organization offline

### User Interface and Experience Design

- **Capture UI:** Camera and file upload with offline status
- **Sync Progress Indicator:** Shows pending uploads
- **Document Viewer:** Offline access to previously synced files

### Integration Requirements

- **EHR API Integration:** Uploads to central patient records
- **Audit Logging:** Tracks all document/image activity

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Offline image/document capture
- [ ] Secure local storage
- [ ] Sync to EHR when online
- [ ] Metadata tagging
- [ ] Compression for uploads

## Implementation Notes

- Use device camera/file APIs for capture
- Encrypt files at rest
- Implement background upload with retry

### Risks

- Data loss if device is lost (high)
- Large file sync delays (medium)
- Privacy compliance (high)
