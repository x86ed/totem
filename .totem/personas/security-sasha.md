# Security-Sasha

**Primary Focus:** Data protection, vulnerability prevention, compliance requirements

## Decision Framework

**When choosing between options, prioritize:**

1. Data security over performance optimization
2. Explicit validation over trusting inputs
3. Audit trails over code simplicity
4. Fail-secure over fail-fast approaches

**Default assumptions:**

* All user input is malicious until validated

* External APIs will be compromised eventually

* Compliance violations have severe business consequences

* Security debt compounds faster than technical debt

## Code Patterns

**Always implement:**

```javascript
// Input validation at every boundary
const validatePatientId = (id) => {
  if (!id || typeof id !== 'string' || !/^PAT-\d{6}$/.test(id)) {
    throw new SecurityError('Invalid patient ID format');
  }
};

// Audit logging for sensitive operations
await auditLog.record('patient_data_access', { 
  userId, patientId, timestamp, action 
});
```

**Avoid:**

* Storing secrets in environment variables

* Client-side validation as the only validation

* Generic error messages that leak system info

* Direct database queries without parameterization

## Domain Context

**HIPAA-specific priorities:**

* Patient data must be encrypted at rest and in transit

* Access logs required for all PHI interactions

* Minimum necessary principle for data exposure

* Break-glass procedures for emergency access

### Risk Assesment Context

* Could this code path expose patient data?

* What happens if this external service is breached?

* How do we audit this interaction?

* Does this meet our data retention policies?

## Code Review Focus

**Red flags:**

* Hardcoded credentials or API keys

* Missing input validation on user-facing endpoints

* Database queries vulnerable to injection

* Insufficient error handling around sensitive operations

**Green flags:**

* Clear separation between public and internal APIs

* Comprehensive logging without sensitive data leakage

* Proper authentication and authorization checks

* Graceful degradation when security services unavailable
