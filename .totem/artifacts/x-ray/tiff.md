# Working with TIFF Files (.tif, .tiff)

TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is used for high-quality, lossless storage of X-ray images, especially in research and publication.

## Viewing TIFF Files
- Use general image viewers (IrfanView, XnView, Preview on macOS, GIMP, Photoshop).
- ImageJ is popular for scientific and medical TIFFs.

## Converting TIFF Files
- Convert TIFF to other formats using ImageJ, Photoshop, or command-line tools like `convert` (ImageMagick).
- Export from DICOM to TIFF using ImageJ or RadiAnt.

## Metadata
- TIFF can store metadata, but it is not standardized for medical use. Use ExifTool to inspect metadata.
