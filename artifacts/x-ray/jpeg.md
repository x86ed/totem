# Working with JPEG Files (.jpg, .jpeg)

JPEG is a common format for sharing or archiving X-ray images outside clinical systems. It is lossy and not recommended for diagnostic use.

## Viewing JPEG Files
- Use any standard image viewer (Windows Photos, Preview on macOS, web browsers).

## Converting JPEG Files
- Convert JPEG to other formats using ImageJ, Photoshop, or ImageMagick.
- Export from DICOM to JPEG using ImageJ, RadiAnt, or dcm2jpg.

## Compression and Quality
- JPEG uses lossy compression. Avoid repeated saves to prevent quality loss.
